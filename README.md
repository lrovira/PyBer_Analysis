### Challenge 5 

# Analysis:
This analysis was done to find out the total fare based on city type and be able to analyze its performance. After the initial analysis from PyBear I resumed all key metrics in separate daframes. First step in this analysis was combine the cvs files in a single dataframe to then calculate different metrics. This allowed me to compare and contrast the information in order to find out the total rides, fares, driver count and averages of some of these metrics. This was achieved by utilizing the groupby() and copy() methods. By utilizing a line graph I was able to analyze and demonstrate the trend baby City Type week over week. What the graph Total Fare by City Type demonstrates that urban cities have the leading contribution in addition to weekly trends. For example, at the end of February demand reach its highest from all three categories that can be rooted to the beginning of spring break.

The challenge that I came across when analyzing the data, was when I entered the data. The reason for this is because when entering values or information I had to be careful of entering exactly every value or number correct. Any missing symbol or values would result in an incomplete or problem in the progress or average. I would resolve this by analyzing already entered data or deleting and re enter the data to double check information. 

Based on the analysis the average fare of the suburban and rural cities is between 15% and 30% which is higher than those of the urban cities. This could be the reason why people from the suburban and rural areas of the city do not utilize the application due to the higher fare compared to the city services. My recommendation would be to create another analysis of the market specifically targeting the suburban and rural areas to analyze exactly how many and who is actually utilizing the application. By doing this we would be able to learn what would be the best strategy to promote the application and motivate people to utilize it. In addition to this a survey can be created upon download with specific questions that would serve us to collect more data and offer a free ride as an incentive to promote people to answer them.
